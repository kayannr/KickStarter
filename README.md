### Dataset Limitations 
One limitation of the dataset that can be considered is that the data is only available for
the years and months included.  The data also does not include the other reasons why the campaigns failed or were canceled. The status is only based on meeting the goals and doesn’t show other reasons why some of the campaigns were canceled or failed. It might be helpful to identify these reasons in order to avoid the failure of other campaigns in the future. Another limitation is the source of the dataset. Since the source is unknown, it can be considered unreliable. The data also doesn’t provide any information regarding why a particular campaign ends at the specified date after gaining a successful outcome. Each campaign ends at different dates and pledged amount but the data does not show why.
